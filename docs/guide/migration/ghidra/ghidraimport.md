## Importing data
### Import to a new file

### Import to an existing file
`Plugins > Ghidra Import > Import Database...` allows you to apply analysis information from a Ghidra file to an already open binary view in Binary Ninja. You are able to select a single `.gbf` file or project file from a `.gpr`. You can choose to import all or only some categories of analysis information to apply to the binary view.

### Import to an existing project
!!! note

`Plugins > Ghidra Import > Import Project...` allows you to import files from a Ghidra project (`.gpr`) to an open Binary Ninja project. All available analysis information will be imported for all selected files.
